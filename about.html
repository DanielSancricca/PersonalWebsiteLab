    <p>Wiseau remains private about the details of his personal and family life. In 2017, he told Entertainment Weekly, "I think private life should be private life, the professional life should be the professional life, and that's where I stand, and I have right to do that." During a 2016 interview with James Franco, Wiseau referred to Greg Sestero as his "best friend". In a December 2017 interview with Howard Stern, he claimed to speak fluent French and said he is a Catholic.
        In early 2020, Wiseau was ordered by a Canadian judge to pay $550,000 in lost revenue and $200,000 in punitive damages to the makers of the documentary Room Full of Spoons, after Wiseau tried to block the film's release, feeling it depicted him in a negative way.</p>
